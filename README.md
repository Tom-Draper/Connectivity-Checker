# Connectivity Checker

A full-stack app to monitor performance of my personal web apps.

Hosted at: https://connectivity-checker.netlify.app/

Components:

- Frontend built with Svelte, TypeScript and Plotly.js
- Backend server built with Go
- MongoDB database storing response times
- A Go program to measure response times and update the database, scheduled as a cron job to update hourly

UI heavily inspired by Better Uptime's status page.
